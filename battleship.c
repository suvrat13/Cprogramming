/**
 * Calculates the probability of hitting a battleship at a specific grid location Gij
 * in a battleship game board defined by R rows and C columns.
 *
 * The function assumes that battleships are placed on the grid according to the game rules,
 * and computes the likelihood that a shot fired at location (i, j) will result in a hit.
 *
 * @param R The number of rows in the battleship grid.
 * @param C The number of columns in the battleship grid.
 * @param i The row index of the target grid location (0-based).
 * @param j The column index of the target grid location (0-based).
 * @return The probability (as a double) of hitting a battleship at location Gij.
